# Gaze Detection moondream2
A helpful Jupyter notebook that uses the Moondream 2B model to detect faces and their gaze directions in videos. It processes videos frame by frame, visualizing face detections and gaze directions.

Works super well with the free tier GPU in colab. The time taken would be proportional to the length of the video. Start with a 5-10 second long video for an idea of probable duration.
